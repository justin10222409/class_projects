                <h3>Key Villains in Demon Slayer</h3>
                <p>
                The central antagonist in <em>Demon Slayer</em> is Muzan Kibutsuji, the first and most powerful demon. 
                He is responsible for creating almost all other demons and embodies cruelty and fear. Muzan’s blood 
                grants demons immense strength, but it also enslaves them to his will. Alongside him are the Twelve 
                Kizuki (Twelve Demon Moons), an elite group of demons ranked by strength. Notable among them is Akaza, 
                an Upper Rank demon who relishes battle and shows respect only to powerful opponents. Doma, another 
                Upper Rank, hides his sadism behind a cheerful façade, consuming countless humans without remorse. 
                Each demon presents not only terrifying abilities but also tragic pasts, adding emotional depth to 
                their battles. The complexity of these villains makes the Demon Slayer Corps’ mission both dangerous 
                and emotionally charged.

            <h3>Key Villains in One Punch Man</h3>
                <p>
                <em>One Punch Man</em> introduces a wide range of villains, each with unique abilities and personalities. 
                Boros, the leader of the Dark Matter Thieves, is one of the few enemies who pushes Saitama beyond a 
                single punch, showcasing his incredible regenerative powers and destructive energy blasts. The Monster 
                Association later emerges as a major threat, led by monstrous beings like Orochi, a towering, 
                near-godlike creature of immense power. Another central antagonist is Garou, a martial arts prodigy who 
                calls himself the “Hero Hunter.” Unlike typical monsters, Garou is human, which makes his descent into 
                villainy more compelling as he questions the nature of heroism. Many villains embody exaggerated traits
                whether arrogance, brutality, or ambition that Saitama inevitably deflates with ease. Yet, their presence 
                drives much of the conflict, keeping the story dynamic despite Saitama’s overwhelming power.
