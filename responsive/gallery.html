            <h2>Games I'm Enjoying</h2>
            <p>I enjoy playing Escape from Tarkov because of the intensity and high stakes. Every raid feels like a gamble, and the risk of losing everything makes it that much more rewarding when I succeed. Borderlands 4 is my escape into chaos it’s full of wild guns, nonstop action, and humor that keeps things light. I enjoy the grind there because it never feels dull; there’s always something new to chase. Rocket League gives me a completely different thrill with its fast-paced matches and focus on precision. Scoring a clutch goal or pulling off a clean aerial feels amazing, especially in tough games. Together, these three games balance everything I want in gaming: challenge, fun, and competition.</p>
