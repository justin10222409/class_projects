              <p>Tanjiro Kamado is the protagonist, known for his kindness and determination. He was born into a humble family that sold charcoal in the mountains. After his family was slaughtered by demons, and his sister turned into one, he vowed to protect Nezuko and joined the Demon Slayer Corps to both avenge his family and find a way to restore her humanity. Nezuko Kamado, younger sister of Tanjiro, who was turned into a demon during the attack on their family. Unlike most demons, Nezuko manages to resist the urge to harm humans, thanks to her strong will and the sibling bond with Tanjiro. She sleeps in a box he carries during the day to avoid sunlight, which is deadly to demons, and she fights alongside him using her enhanced strength and regenerative abilities. Zenitsu Agatsuma is a fellow Demon Slayer who is often cowardly and anxious, but surprisingly powerful when pushed to his limits. He was forced into joining the Corps after being tricked into debt repayment, but he trained under a Thunder Breathing master. Despite his constant fear, Zenitsu has incredible combat abilities when unconscious, allowing him to unleash his “Thunderclap and Flash” attacks with great speed and precision. Inosuke Hashibira is another Demon Slayer who grew up in the mountains, raised by wild boars after being abandoned as a baby. Because of this upbringing, he developed beast-like instincts and fighting skills, eventually creating his own “Beast Breathing” style. Inosuke is hot-headed, brash, and competitive, but over time he learns the value of friendship and teamwork with Tanjiro and the others.</p>
